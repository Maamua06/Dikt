DIKT OM IM


IM class, a place of diversity
Where gamers, football fans, and hackers all agree
To embrace our differences, and celebrate what's true
In this special space, where friendships renew

We come together, in this inclusive space
To learn and grow, at our own pace
We share our passions, and we find common ground
In IM class, we all feel profound

IM class is a place of connection and care
Where we support one another, and show we're aware
Of the unique talents and interests each of us holds
In IM class, our stories are told

IM class, a place of diverse minds
Where gamers, football fans, and hackers intertwine
We may have different hobbies, and different passions too
But in IM class, we accept and embrace what's true

We come together in this unique space
To learn and grow, at our own pace
There's no one here to judge or shun
We can be ourselves, and have fun

IM class is a place of friendship and cheer
Where we support one another, and hold each other dear
We share our interests, and we find common ground
In IM class, we rise above


So whether you're a football fan, or a gaming pro
Or a hacker at heart, in IM class, don't you know
There's a place for you, and all that you love
In IM class, we rise above.
